# Retro++

A simple and intuitive tool for team retrospectives.

Built by [Gabriel Romualdo](https://GabrielRomualdo.com).

## Get Started

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```

## Deployment

Deployed with Vercel.

## Backend & Database

Firebase realtime database. Right now this doesn't use the Firebase SDK for React, and instead loads the vanilla JS SDK into a global object on `window`.
